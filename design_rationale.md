Design rationale:

- FAQ is addressed to both authors and reviewers ("you" is avoided since it's ambiguous)
- FAQ focuses on the "what" (what are the accepted practices?) rather than the "how" (how to do things?)
- The "what" often admits multiples possible answers: there's rarely a single way to do things
- Nevertheless, some approaches are better than others
- FAQ uses external references as much as possible. Original content is avoided.
- FAQ also briefly defines terms when it helps
- FAQ should be as compact as possible, avoid repetitions and redundancies, and lengthy explanations (use refs instead)
